        <p>We may also rely on legitimate interests for our direct marketing. Our legitimate interests are to inform individuals about products or services which may be of interest to them and our commercial interests in operating our business, which includes acquiring new customers, providing additional services to existing or previous customers and, expanding our operations.</p>
        
        <p>You may also receive marketing communications from us if you have previously purchased similar goods or services from us and, in each case, you have not opted-out of receiving that marketing.  This is known as a ‘soft opt-in’.</p>
        
        <p>Such marketing communications may be in relation to claims management, financial advice/services and legal services which could be done by post, email, SMS or telephone.</p>  
        
        <p>To opt out of receiving future marketing from us under a soft opt-in or under legitimate interest, please opt-out using the details in the ‘General’ section of this Privacy Policy.</p>

We also have some legal and regulatory obligations to hold certain pieces of information for specific timeframes for example, we are required to keep a copy of telephone call recordings for a period of 12 months after our last contact with you. </p> 
        
        <p>Where we have provided a service to you, we will hold all information relevant to this for 6 years to enable us to address any claims/complaints made about our service. Information relating to any complaints will be held for a further 3 years.</p>
        
        <p>We also need to keep some of your information for our accounting and reporting requirements.</p>
