        <p>We pride ourselves in continually acting in the best interests of our clients. We do however
understand that there are instances when a client may feel that they have cause to complain.</p>

        <p>If you have a complaint we need to know about it and we would ask that you inform us as soon as possible so that the issue can be addressed. This can be done via fax, email, telephone, in writing or in person. The address for such communications should be:</p>

<p>
<strong>The Complaints Team,<br />
Henderson Claims Limited,<br />
Unit 2, Ashbrook Office Park,<br />
Manchester,<br />

<strong>By telephone:</strong> 0161 359 7140 <br />
Or in person by visiting our premises (address detailed above).</p>

<p>We will promptly, send you a written or electronic acknowledgement upon receipt of your complaint, giving the name or job title of the individual handling the complaint, together with details of our internal complaints handling procedures.</p> 

<p>Alternatively, if we are able to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction within 3 working days, we will send you a summary resolution letter which details your complaint, how we intend to resolve it and how you can escalate your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service in the future, should you decide that you are unhappy with our resolution.</p>

<p>If we are not able to resolve your complaint within 3 working days we will then investigate the
matter and by the end of eight weeks from receipt of the complaint, send you:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>I. a final response which will also inform you of your referral rights to complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service, the timeframe for doing so, full contact details for the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Financial Ombudsman Service’s consumer leaflet; or</li>
            <li>II. a response which:
                <ul>
                    <li>i. explains that we are still not in a position to make a final response, giving reasons for the further delay and indicating when we expect to be able to provide a final response; and</li>
                    <li>ii. ii. informing you in writing that you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service, the timeframe for doing so, full contact details for the Financial Ombudsman Service and the Financial Ombudsman Service’s consumer leaflet.</li>
                </ul> 
            </li>       
       </ul>

<p>If we are unable to resolve your complaint to your satisfaction or we are unable to provide you with a final response within the prescribed timescales, you can have the complaint independently looked at by the Financial Ombudsman Service.</p>
<p>The Financial Ombudsman Service can investigate complaints up to six years from the date of
the problem happening or within three years of when you found out about the problem.</p>
<p>If you wish to refer your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service this should be done
within 6 months of the date of our final response or summary resolution letter.</p>
